Greetings!

If you have been using this "handy" little script to convert videos you may have noticed some "issues".
Fear not, these issues are the caused by nor affecting the script. In short, the FFmpeg available within
the Ubuntu / Debian repositories is not the correct version to use anymore. When I have the free time,
which has been limited for a while now, I will update the script to check the installed FFmpeg version.
I am still deciding on what actions to take when an incorrect / unusable version is found, but hey, it
all comes with the territory of programming!

For now, I recommend more advanced users to build FFmpeg and dependencies from source. For everyone else
please visit the FFmpeg website and download the latest binaries. The link is http://ffmpeg.org/download.html

That is it for now.
