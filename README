1. Introduction
==============================================================================
First the development team would like to take the opportunity to thank you for
your interest in our little python program. We will assume that since you have
downloaded it and happen to be viewing the read me you have a general idea of
what the program does. In short this Python program will convert almost any
video format into almost any other format. We won't go into the exact details
in this section, but when everything is setup the conversion process will be
as simple as drag and drop any video(s) you wish to convert onto the program
and walk away.

==============================================================================
1-A. Known Issues/Bugs, and Important notes
==============================================================================
Due to a few dependencies receiving updates we are unable to guarantee proper
functionality of KVConvertor. We are currently working on resolving issues
that have arisen from this and will release a new version when available.

==============================================================================

3. Minimum / Recommended Requirements
==============================================================================
As far as hardware is concerned we have not tested for minimum requirements at
this time. Because of this I will provide the basic computer setup that is in
use for writing/running the program.

System 1 is a Dell Inspiron 1525 Laptop
    CPU:
        Intel Core 2 Duo T8100 / 2.1GHz, L2 Cache - 2MB (Dual-Core)
    Memory:
        4GB (plus 4GB swap partition)
    HDD:
        500GB 10k rpm SATA
	Video:
	    Integrated Mobile Intel
    Operating System:
	    Linux Mint 8 64bit
		
System 2 is a virtual machine running on a second Inspiron 1525
    Host Computer runs on similar hardware as above, the host OS is
	  Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit. The virtual machine is running in VirtualBox
	  as such I will only list relevant differences.
	  
	Memory:
	    1.5GB
	HDD:
	    20GB Virtual HDD
	    
System 3 is custom built
    CPU:
	    Intel CeleronD 2.2GHz
	Memory:
	    4GB DDR2 (plus 8GB Swap partition)
	HDD:
	    Primary, 300GB 10k rpm SATA
		Secondary, 1TB 10k rpm SATA
	Video:
	    nVidia 7600 256MB from BioStar
	Operating System:
	    Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS

4. Install / Setup
==============================================================================
As of when this README was updated the program has only been tested on Debian
based Linux distro's, so I have written an installation script that should
take care of downloading and installing the required dependancies.

****WARNING****
The installation script was written for machines running Python 2.7.x ONLY,
and only for Debian based platforms, as such use with EXTREME CAUTION as I am
not liable or responsible for any possible damage that may be caused from its
use. If you do choose to use it, run it from a terminal if you would like to
keep an eye on it's progress.

**UPDATE**
I have received a few emails regarding the same concern so I will address it
now as well as in the FAQ section.

Q. When I run the installation script I am prompted for my password, <insert
various concerns about computer/account security>. Why does it need this?

A. It is not my script that is actually prompting you for your password. What
is happening is the script is assuming you are logged in as a user with the
priviledges to install and not as root. In order to install these packages it
is using "sudo" at the beginning of each command. For more information visit:
  http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/306766:linux-101-introduction-to-sudo



For those readers / users not using a Debian based Linux OS:

1. Download and install all listed dependancies from your accessible
repositories, EXCEPT pymediainfo.

2. Download pymediainfo. You can do this by going to:

  http://tinyurl.com/d9zdcze

This will immediately start the download from pypi.python.org, if you do not
trust tinyurl addresses then feel free to download it from:

  pypi.python.org/pypi/pymediainfo

3. Create a directory to place KVConvertor.py into

4. Navigate to the KVConvertor.py's directory and create subdirectory to put
The pymediainfo files into.

5. Navigate to this location in a terminal and type:
      python setup.py build
   
   Followed by:
      python setup.py install
	  
6. Everything should now be installed and ready to for us to configure the KVC
Python program.

==============================================================================
5. Configuration
==============================================================================
We tried to make this as easy as possible for everyone, but again if you run
into any troubles please contact us and we will do our best to resolve it.

For first time use:
1. Ensure KVConvertor.py is executable:
      chmod 0777 /pathtofile/KVConvertor.py

2. Run KVC without arguements
      python /pathtofile/KVConvertor.py
	        or
	  ./pathtofile/KVConvertor.py

3. Read and answer the questions

4. It's ready, run it again with arguements this time
      python /pathtofile/KVConvertor.py [video1] [video2] ... etc
	        or
	  ./pathtofile/KVConvertor.py [video1] [video2] ... etc

Optionally you can create a desktop launcher leading to KVConvertor for drag
and drop functionality. Be sure to add %F to the end of the launcher's
command line.
